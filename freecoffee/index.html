<h1>Free Coffee</h1>

<p>Free Coffee was founded on the idea that <strong>coffee should be free.</strong></p>

<p>Not free of charge, of course. But free of toxins. Free of limits. Free of preconceptions.</p>

<p>We're not your grandmother's Folgers or your dad's office's sad carafe, which someone made last week and people have been stretching out ever since, no one willing to sacrifice five seconds to dump the preground beans into the uncleaned basket.</p>

<p>No, we're something different. <strong>We're free.</strong></p>

<p>To us, freedom means childhood. It means running through wooded glens, dew caressing our toes. It means clambering up on neighbors' weather-worn porches to hear a good story. It means peeking under the bed for monsters or magic. It means being real.</p>

<p>Our coffee is as free as its gets. Our organic, free range coffee farmers own their own land. They own their own plants. They own their own beans. (Until they sell them to us, of course.) They are free to roam the farm, fertilize the fields, harvest the crops. Or, they're free to let it all go. To stand on the mountain top and listen. To small the scent of coffee growing wild and heed the call of possibility.</p>
</p>

<p>Perhaps best of all, our coffee is 100% vegan and gluten free.</p>

<p>Free. Like coffee should be.</p>
