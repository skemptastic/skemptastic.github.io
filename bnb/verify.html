	<p>So you're looking to verify our credentials, eh? Well, we don't blame you. We'd do the same if we were in your shoes. But we're not: we're in gumshoes, you see?</p>
	<p>A few of the many past lives, we mean wives, we mean cases, in which we've been successful include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Finding the man who murdered Corlina Mustarde in her parlor with a penknife</li>
			<li>Catching wily old Jack Sparrow with his pegleg in some booty</li>
			<li>Tracking down a business associate who'd absconded with the dough (and, more importantly, getting the dough back – and we don't mean sourdough)</li>
			<li>Sniffing out the dirty dog who left Evaline hanging </li>
		</ul>

	<p>You might also ask us to put you in touch with a client or two, or feel free to call around yourself. We think you'll find our dossier's in tip top shape.</p>
