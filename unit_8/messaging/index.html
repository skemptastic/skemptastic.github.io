<h2>Core Messaging</h2>

<p>If you asked everyone in your company what you do, would everyone give the same answer?</p>

<p>Probably not. And that's the case for most companies. That makes it easy to recognize successful companies: they're the ones where everyone on staff can explain what they do and why they do it in a clear, compelling, and consistent manner.</p>

<p>I can help you figure out the best way to explain this. But it's going to take strong effort from within to make it pervade. Once people adopt their own ways of looking at your company.</p>

<p>Core messaging deliverables include:

<ul>
<li>3 hours onsite interviewing you<li>
<li>30-word positioning statement/li>
<li>50-, 100-, and 150-word company description/li>
<li>1-page (250-300-word) document outlining the marketplace, reason, and mission of your company</li>
<li>Suggested exercises for presenting and socializing messaging within company</li>
<ul>
</p>

<p>The messaging should inform everything you do, say, and think about the company. If you find yourself wanting to change it constantly, you may not have figured out what you're doing yet.</p>
