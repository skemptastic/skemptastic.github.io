here are some reflections

Why use remote rather than local?

A remote repository helps you share your work with other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You may also want to commit and push your changes. When you're finished, click "Next".

A fork is a part of someone else's project that you've pulled out to work on something specific that probably changes the general direction of that project. It's also a feature particular to GitHub.

Use a branch to experiment with building a new feature without disturbing the master branch, but probably with the idea of bringing it back together later (that is, not creating a whole new thing).

Clone something entirely to turn it into a new project.
